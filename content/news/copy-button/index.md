Copy the content of code blocks easily into your clipboard.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

We can select parts of our content and copy them into the clipboard manually. Code blocks are a special case because they are sometimes long and not so easy to mark manually. Or they contain line numbers we usually donâ€™t like to copy.

Therefore this theme now includes buttons for all fenced code blocks which transfer the whole text content of the `<code>` tag into the clipboard. They appear on mouse hover or touch tap.

Check out the new functionality in the [code block layout demo](/blog/codelayout).
